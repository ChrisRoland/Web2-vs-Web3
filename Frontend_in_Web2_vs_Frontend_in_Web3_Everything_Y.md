## What is Web2 Frontend development?

[*Web 2.0*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/web-20.asp#) front-end development is a paradigm shift from its predecessor, Web 1.0, allowing users to interact with the web pages dynamically and participate in the content creation process. As opposed to static web pages prevalent during the Web 1.0 era, the Web 2.0 era brought about a sense of community and collective content creation, made possible through advanced front-end development.
Using traditional web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, front-end developers in the Web 2.0 era create user-friendly interfaces that allow users to interact with applications and access their features. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the structure and content of the web pages, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) applies the design and style elements, while JavaScript adds interactivity and additional functionalities.
In the Web 2.0 era, user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design have become paramount. The front-end developers often work closely with UX/UI designers, using prototypes and wireframes to guide their work.
Frameworks and libraries such as React or Angular are often employed in Web 2.0 development to help streamline the development process, making it more efficient. These tools provide a structure to the code, promoting code reuse and thus increasing productivity. The goal is not only to create a site that works well but also delivers a seamless, intuitive, and engaging user experience.

## What is Web3 Frontend development?

[*Web 3.0*](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Web-30#) front-end development, frequently referred to as the "Semantic Web", "Web of Data", or the phase of decentralized development is the next evolutionary step of the Internet. This stage of the web is distinguished by a user-focused philosophy that fosters more significant and dynamic interactions between users and applications.
In contrast to the Web 2.0 model that relies on centralized servers for application hosting and management, Web 3.0 adopts decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks. This decentralizes the control and management of applications, shifting power from a centralized authority to individual users. This fundamental change in how data is stored, accessed, and shared across the web results in enhanced privacy and security.
Web3 front-end development utilizes a range of new technologies to accommodate this shift. One of these is Solidity, a dedicated programming language for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference.
Another key component is web3.js, a library that allows developers to interact with a local or remote Ethereum blockchain, thereby facilitating the development of decentralized applications (dApps). Web3 front-end developers may also employ IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), a protocol and network designed to create a content-addressable, peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system.
These innovative technologies provide superior interoperability, allowing diverse services and systems to work together seamlessly. They also enable more efficient data management, as the distributed nature of blockchain ensures secure and transparent data storage and access. In addition, users have more control over their data, improving privacy.
The decentralized nature of Web 3.0 also means that applications can operate without the need for an intermediary, such as a bank in financial transactions. This creates trustless systems, where parties can directly interact with each other, safe in the knowledge that the rules of the system are enforced by the immutable code of smart contracts.
It allows for greater interoperability and more efficient data management, making it an attractive option for many developers and companies.

## Statistics/facts on Web2 and Web3 frontend showing the benefits of transitioning from Web2 to Web3.

Web2, also known as the "read-write" web, is the current dominant model for web development. It is characterized by user-generated content and two-way communication between users and websites. On the other hand, Web3, also known as the "semantic" web, is a future development that aims to make the web more intelligent and intuitive. It will enable machines to understand and interpret web content, making it easier for users to find and access information.
While Web2 is a significant upgrade from its predecessor, has seen its limitations. Its centralized structure creates privacy issues and leaves control in the hands of a few dominant entities. However, the transition to Web3 can solve these issues, offering benefits such as increased user control, improved privacy, and enhanced data security.
To put it in perspective, let's consider some statistics. Over [2,800 DApps](https://blockchain.oodles.io/blog/solana-ethereum-blockchain-dapps/#) are currently running on the Ethereum network, with daily active users exceeding half a million, demonstrating a rising interest in decentralized applications. Additionally, more than $100 billion was locked in various DeFi projects at its peak in 2022, indicating significant trust and growing usage of Web3 financial applications.
Comparatively, traditional Web2 applications, while still dominant, have shown some vulnerabilities. [For instance](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/), the number of reported data breaches in the United States exceeded 1,000 in 2020, affecting hundreds of millions of individuals and reinforcing the need for secure and decentralized systems that Web3 provides.
Also noteworthy is the shift in user preferences. A survey conducted by DappRadar in 2022 indicated that over 60% of respondents were willing to shift to decentralized social media platforms, citing data privacy as the main concern.
Additionally, the advent of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is another example of Web3's potential, according to a report by NonFungible.com, the total market capitalization of NFTs was over a billion USD in 2022, which was virtually nonexistent in the Web2 era.
In sum, transitioning from Web2 to Web3 front-end development can bring a number of benefits. 
For example, Web3 technologies allow for more personalized and relevant user experiences and improved security and privacy. Additionally, Web3 front-end development allows for more seamless integration with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.

## The Comparison between Frontend Development in Web2 and Web3.

Web2 and Web3 significantly differ in their approach to frontend development. Web2 focuses on user-friendly interfaces, interaction, and visual appeal, but it often leaves user data under the control of third parties. On the contrary, Web3 offers more than user interaction and aesthetics. It emphasizes decentralization, which gives users control over their own data and enhances privacy. Unlike Web2, where data is controlled by centralized entities, Web3's decentralized nature reduces reliance on these entities and offers users a more secure and private online experience.
Also, In Web2, interactions are facilitated by centralized servers, meaning any request or transaction has to pass through a central authority. In contrast, Web3 leverages blockchain technology to allow peer-to-peer interactions, removing the need for a middleman. This means transactions are direct, secure, and fast. Web3 also allows for the creation of smart contracts which automatically execute transactions when certain conditions are met, providing a new level of automation and efficiency that Web2 cannot offer. This evolution in technology opens a world of new possibilities and opportunities for innovation in web development, making Web3 an exciting frontier for developers.
Below we will go more in-depth with these comparisons on different factors;

This requires a deep understanding of these technologies, as well as the ability to design and implement user interfaces that are secure, scalable, and efficient.

## Required Skillset.

Frontend developers in both Web2 and Web3 require a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience with responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.  The front-end of a website is the part that users see and interact with. However, the shift towards Web3 introduces the need for additional skills and tools.
In Web2, the front-end is typically built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages are used to create the structure, style, and functionality of a website, frontend developers in Web2 may also need to have experience with a variety of frontend frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js and knowledge of server-side technologies, such as PHP or Ruby on Rails, in order to create dynamic and interactive web applications. They also need to be familiar with version control systems like Git and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools.
In Web3, a fundamental understanding of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps) is essential. In addition, developers must become proficient in interacting with blockchain networks. Libraries like ethers.js and web3.js are commonly used for this purpose. Ethers.js is known for its tiny footprint and modular structure, making it suitable for a variety of applications, while web3.js is a comprehensive library that allows developers to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket.
Furthermore, knowledge of Solidity, the primary language for Ethereum smart contract development, becomes important. Understanding of IPFS and other decentralized storage solutions, and user-friendly wallet integration, such as MetaMask, are also crucial components in a Web3 frontend developer's skillset.
A Web3 front-end developer should have a strong understanding of these technologies in addition to traditional front-end skills.
Overall, the required skillset for frontend development in Web2 and Web3 may overlap in some areas but may also differ in terms of the technologies and frameworks used. It is important for front-end developers to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and best practices in their field in order to remain competitive.

## Products.

In Web2, front-end developers create the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of websites and web applications. This can include anything from simple static websites to complex single-page applications. Product development has primarily been centralized and often controlled by a few major corporations. The products we're most familiar with include social networks like Facebook and Instagram, e-commerce platforms like Amazon, and various SaaS (Software as a Service) applications like Salesforce and Slack. These platforms have brought about immense convenience and have revolutionized the way we interact, shop, and work.
However, these Web2 products have also faced criticism for issues such as data privacy breaches, targeted advertising, and a lack of transparency. For instance, social networks collect enormous amounts of personal data to drive their advertising models, which has led to privacy concerns. Similarly, on e-commerce platforms, third-party sellers often must conform to the rules set by the platform, which can lead to uneven power dynamics. Although Web2 has made great strides in digital product development, the shift to Web3 signifies a push towards greater user control, privacy, and decentralization.
In the Web3 space, the types of products being developed are also drastically different. We see a surge in decentralized applications (DApps), DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), DeFi (Decentralized Finance) platforms, and other decentralized services. These applications are fundamentally changing the way we interact with the web, shifting from a centrally controlled environment to a more open, inclusive, and user-centric ecosystem.
Web3 products prioritize transparency, peer-to-peer interactions, and community governance. They offer innovative ways to monetize content, fund projects, and create digital ownership. DApp developers, in particular, are pioneering this new landscape, creating applications on blockchain platforms like Ethereum that leverage smart contracts to enforce rules and operations. The ability to develop these kinds of innovative Web3 products is another skill set a Web3 front-end developer should strive to acquire.

## Salary.

The salary of a front-end developer working in Web2 versus Web3 can vary depending on a number of factors, including the developer's level of experience, the specific job market they are working in, and the company they are working for, it is difficult to accurately depict how much a frontend developer in Web2 or Web3 might earn. Generally, frontend developers tend to earn good salaries, with the average salary for a frontend developer in the United States being around $82,500 per year according to [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/).
However, front-end developers working in Web3 are likely to earn higher salaries than those working in Web2. This is because Web3 development is a relatively new field that requires a high level of technical expertise and knowledge of cutting-edge technologies like blockchain and decentralized networks. 
However, the demand for Web3 skills is rapidly growing due to the rising interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency. In response, the average salary for a blockchain developer, which includes those focusing on Web3 front-end development, can range significantly higher. Companies are often willing to pay a premium for front-end developers with these skills. According to a report by [Hired](https://hired.com/state-of-software-engineers/2023/), blockchain developers can expect an average salary of around $120,000 - $160,000 per year.
Overall, the main difference between frontend development in Web2 and Web3 is the technologies and platforms that are used. While frontend developers in Web2 may use more traditional web technologies, frontend developers in Web3 will likely need to be familiar with decentralized technologies and blockchain. This could potentially affect their salary, as demand for developers with these skills may be higher and therefore command a higher salary. Therefore, leading to higher salaries for front-end developers in Web3 than those in Web2.

## Data and authentication.

In Web2, Front-end developers typically work with data that is stored on a centralized server. However, the front-end in Web2 is largely dependent on the backend for data and authentication. In other words, the front-end relies on the backend to provide it with the data it needs to display, as well as to verify the identity of users. This means that the server is responsible for managing user data and authentication, and the front-end developer's role is to present this data to the user in a user-friendly way. Authentication is usually done through traditional methods like usernames and passwords or OAuth tokens, and the user data is stored on the server side. This data is controlled by the companies running these servers, which has led to privacy concerns and data breaches.
In contrast, Web3 offers a more user-centric approach to data and authentication. With Web3, data can be owned and controlled by the user and is often stored in decentralized systems. One of the fundamental differences in Web3 is the integration of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIDs allow users to authenticate themselves directly, without the need for a centralized authority or third-party validation. This method enhances privacy and security, granting users full control and ownership over their data.
In addition to DIDs, Web3 frontend development also involves understanding and integrating various blockchain-based authentication systems, such as Ethereum's MetaMask or other wallet-based sign-in methods. This shift towards decentralized and user-centric data systems is a significant aspect of Web3 development.
This broader understanding of data ownership, control, and authentication is crucial for a Web3 developer, requiring a shift in both mindset and technical skills.
